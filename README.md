# FIFA Player Data Analysis Project

This project is an exercise and exploratory analysis of FIFA player data, focusing on player attributes, market values, wages, and other key performance indicators. The analysis includes visualizations of player demographics, skill correlations, positional characteristics, and comparisons based on preferred foot and potential. The goal is to practice data analysis techniques and gain insights into player valuation and performance metrics in professional football.

## Project Overview  
The main objectives of this project are:  
1. **Data Preparation and Cleaning**:  
   - Selected and cleaned relevant columns from the FIFA dataset to focus on key player attributes such as age, position, value, wage, skills, and physical features.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Examined distributions of player characteristics such as age, height, weight, and skills.  
   - Investigated correlations between different attributes to identify patterns.  
3. **Focused Analyses**:  
   - Compared players based on their preferred foot (left vs right) in terms of counts, market value, and wages.  
   - Explored age and potential relationships, especially for young talents.  
   - Compared notable players (e.g., Messi vs Ronaldo) using radar charts of multiple performance metrics.  
4. **Visualization**:  
   - Created charts such as heatmaps, bar plots, scatter plots, pie charts, and radar charts to communicate findings clearly.

## Dataset Description  
The dataset used is the **FIFA Player Dataset**, containing attributes for thousands of professional footballers worldwide. Key columns include:  

- **Player Information**: Name, Age, Nationality, Club, Preferred Foot, Position  
- **Performance Metrics**: Overall rating, Potential, Skill Moves, Various skill ratings (e.g., Dribbling, Passing, Shooting)  
- **Economic Attributes**: Market Value, Wage  
- **Physical Attributes**: Height, Weight, Body Type  

This dataset is publicly available and widely used for football analytics.

## Tools Used  
- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)**: For data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization.  
- **Google Colab**: For interactive coding, documenting analysis steps, and presenting findings.

## Skills Practiced  
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Handling missing values, renaming columns, filtering data.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Using statistical methods and visualization to understand data.  
- **Visualization Techniques**: Crafting various chart types to display complex relationships clearly.  
- **Insight Generation**: Drawing conclusions from data about player valuation and characteristics.

## Acknowledgments  
The FIFA player dataset was sourced from [Kaggle FIFA 17 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/artimous/complete-fifa-2017-player-dataset-global). This analysis builds on publicly available data to explore football analytics.
